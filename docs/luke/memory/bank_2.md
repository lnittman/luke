# Memory Bank 2: Tech Documentation System Enhancements

## Progress Summary from Bank 1

The initial memory bank documented the following major components:

1. **Project Generation System Architecture**:
   - Implementation of a modular project generation system with components like idea generation, tech stack generation, and project content generation
   - Refactoring of the API route into a more maintainable structure

2. **Interaction Flows**:
   - Random idea generation with/without prompts
   - Direct project generation
   - Tech exploration
   - Flow for generating command prompts

3. **LLM Provider Architecture**:
   - Provider-based system for generating responses
   - Model-agnostic design supporting multiple LLM providers

4. **Tech Documentation Retrieval**:
   - System that uses Jina's readDocumentation to crawl tech documentation
   - Storage of documentation in a flat structure

## Current System Enhancements

### Tech Documentation System Improvements

We've enhanced the tech documentation system with a directory-based approach:

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - Base directory: `docs/tech/`
   - Each technology now has its own subdirectory: `docs/tech/{technology-name}/`
   - Within each tech directory:
     - `index.md`: Main documentation file
     - `_index.md`: Table of contents/index of all related documents
     - Related documents as individual markdown files

2. **File Organization**:
   - Main documentation stored as `index.md`
   - Related documents stored with sanitized filenames based on URL
   - Index file (`_index.md`) provides navigation to all documents

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Fixed integration with Jina's documentation reader
   - Enhanced link extraction and document fetching
   - Added metadata tracking for each document
   - Implemented caching with automatic invalidation

4. **Function Upgrades**:
   - `fetchTechDocumentationDir`: Fetches and stores tech documentation in directory structure
   - `getTechDocDirectory`: Retrieves stored documentation from the filesystem
   - `clearTechDocCache`: Clears the in-memory cache for tech documentation
   - Helper functions for managing directory creation, file paths, and content extraction

5. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/tech/docs/[name]`: Retrieves documentation for a specific technology
   - `/api/tech/docs`: Lists all available tech documentation
   - `/api/tech/docs/search`: Searches across all tech documentation
   - `/api/tech/docs/refresh`: Refreshes the tech documentation cache
   - `/api/tech/docs/migrate`: Migrates from old flat structure to new directory structure

## Current State

### Completed Tasks

1. âœ… Fixed the integration with Jina's readDocumentation function
2. âœ… Implemented directory-based storage for tech documentation
3. âœ… Enhanced link extraction and related document fetching
4. âœ… Created utility functions for managing tech documentation directories
5. âœ… Implemented in-memory caching with automatic invalidation
6. âœ… Updated API endpoints to use the new directory structure
7. âœ… Added search functionality across all tech documentation
8. âœ… Created migration tool for converting from old flat structure

### In Progress

1. ðŸ”„ Updating the web UI to browse the structured documentation
2. ðŸ”„ Enhancing the context helper to use the new tech documentation structure

## Next Steps

### Tech Documentation System

1. **User Interface Enhancements**:
   - Create a document browser component for navigating the directory structure
   - Add a search interface for finding content across all documentation
   - Implement a "related documents" sidebar

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement background refreshing of outdated documentation
   - Add support for concurrent fetching with rate limiting
   - Optimize search algorithm for large documentation sets

3. **Content Improvements**:
   - Implement automatic summarization of documentation
   - Extract and organize code examples
   - Generate quick reference guides

### Project Generator Improvements

1. **Context Helper**:
   - Complete the context helper module by fixing any remaining issues
   - Enhance context gathering to include tech documentation from the new structure
   - Implement smarter context selection based on project requirements

2. **API Routes**:
   - Improve error handling and request validation
   - Add rate limiting and caching headers
   - Implement better progress tracking for long-running operations

## Technical Debt and Improvements

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Consider moving tech documentation functionality to a separate module
   - Standardize error handling across the codebase
   - Improve type safety by reducing use of `any` types

2. **Performance**:
   - Implement incremental updates of tech documentation
   - Add support for concurrent fetching with rate limiting
   - Optimize memory usage for large documentation sets

3. **Features**:
   - Add support for image extraction and storage
   - Implement table of contents generation
   - Add support for versioning documentation
   - Create a documentation diff tool to track changes over time

# Luke Project Memory Bank 2 - UI Enhancements

## Recent Progress: Tech Documentation System Integration

### Changes Implemented

1. **UI Integration of Tech Documentation System**
   - Added a tab system to the existing document panel to separate project documents from tech documentation
   - Modified the "Documents" dropdown to display two tabs: "Project" and "Documentation"
   - Changed label from "generated documents" to "project" for better clarity
   - Implemented filtering logic to separate tech-related documents from project documents
   - Ensured the UI maintains its clean, minimal aesthetic while adding new functionality

2. **Component Cleanup**
   - Removed unused `FloatingDocPanel.tsx` component from `src/components`
   - Ensured consistent usage of `DocDropdownMenu` component throughout the application 
   - Fixed linter errors related to the tech document filtering logic

### Current State

The Luke application now has an integrated document panel with tabs that separate:
- **Project Documents**: Generated documents related to the current project (index, design, code, initialization)
- **Tech Documentation**: Technical documentation fetched from external sources

This integration allows users to access both project-specific documentation and technical reference material from a single, convenient interface without cluttering the UI.

### Next Steps

1. **Enhancement of Tech Documentation System**
   - Finalize the directory-based approach for storing tech documentation
   - Improve the Jina module to support comprehensive tech documentation retrieval
   - Implement metadata tracking for tech documentation sources
   - Add caching mechanisms for faster access to frequently used documentation

2. **Refine UI Experience**
   - Consider adding visual indicators for document types within each tab
   - Implement search functionality within the document panel
   - Add options to export or share specific documents
   - Consider a "pinned documents" feature for frequently accessed documentation

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update user documentation to reflect the new tabbed interface
   - Document the tech documentation retrieval and display process
   - Create examples of how to effectively use the integrated documentation system

The UI changes provide a foundation for further enhancements to the tech documentation system while maintaining a clean, focused user experience.
