# modo: The AI-Native Workspace**

> *A minimalist AI workspace that understands and executes complex tasks across your digital ecosystem without switching contexts.*

## Concept Overview
modo is an AI-native command center that brings the Rabbit R1's "Large Action Model" philosophy to the web, enabling users to accomplish multi-step workflows through a single, streamlined interface. Rather than juggling dozens of SaaS tools and browser tabs, users interact with a utilitarian text interface that understands natural language instructions and executes them across connected services.

The app targets knowledge workers, developers, and digital professionals drowning in tool sprawl, offering them a centralized workspace that reduces cognitive load. As AI capabilities advance and API ecosystems mature by 2025, modo capitalizes on the growing frustration with fragmented workflows while embracing the minimalist, text-first aesthetic popularized by Teenage Engineering and YZY designs.

## Core Features

* **Universal Command Bar** — Type natural language instructions like "summarize my unread emails and schedule follow-ups for anything urgent" and Modus handles the entire workflow across services without requiring you to switch contexts.

* **Workflow Automation** — Create, save, and share complex workflows that span multiple services (e.g., "When I receive a Slack message from my manager, add any action items to my task list and schedule time on my calendar").

* **Context-Aware AI** — Modus maintains awareness of your recent activities, preferences, and working style, allowing it to suggest optimizations and anticipate needs without explicit instructions.

* **Service Connectors** — Integrates with popular productivity tools, development environments, and communication platforms via a growing library of connectors, with a simple authorization flow.

* **Minimal Visualization Layer** — When visual information is necessary, modo renders clean, information-dense, perplexity inspired tiles/displays that emphasize function over form.

## User Experience

Modus embraces a deliberately austere aesthetic with a left-aligned, monospace Iosevka interface that evokes the directness of terminal interfaces while maintaining modern accessibility. The workspace is dominated by a central command input area, with an optional sidebar for saved workflows and recent activities.

The interface uses subtle animations via Framer Motion to indicate processing states and transitions between contexts. Phosphor Duotone icons provide visual anchors without overwhelming the minimal design. All interactions prioritize keyboard navigation, with a focus on reducing friction between intent and execution.

Results appear in a scrollable, collapsible thread below the command bar, allowing users to review outputs and refine instructions. The experience deliberately avoids flashy UI elements, instead focusing on utility and information density — a "web2 vibe" that paradoxically makes its AI capabilities feel more approachable and trustworthy.

## Technical Implementation

modo leverages Next.js 15's server components and React Server Actions to create a responsive interface with minimal client-side JavaScript. The app uses Prisma for data modeling and persistence, storing user preferences, workflow templates, and integration credentials.

The core AI orchestration layer uses a combination of Priompt for structured prompting and Mastra for agent coordination, allowing complex tasks to be broken down and executed across multiple services. Tailwind and shadcn provide the styling foundation, with custom components built to maintain the utilitarian aesthetic.

Authentication flows through Auth.js, while service integrations are managed through a combination of official APIs and, where necessary, controlled browser automation for services without robust API access.

## Go-To-Market Strategy

modo will launch with a focused set of integrations targeting developers (GitHub, VS Code, Terminal), communication tools (Slack, Gmail), and project management platforms (Linear, Notion). This technical audience will appreciate both the minimalist interface and the powerful automation capabilities.

Growth will be driven by a freemium model allowing users to connect up to three services for free, with a premium tier for additional connections and advanced workflows. The ability to share workflows creates natural virality, as teams can benefit from each other's automation recipes.

Strategic partnerships with developer tools and productivity platforms will provide additional distribution channels, positioning modo as the user-friendly "command layer" that immediately makes their existing tools more powerful through AI orchestration with controls exposed in a pleasurable, design forward, utilitarian UI
