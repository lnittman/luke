if you could make a utility pnpm command that updates / finds new tech and associated docs to write out new tech/<tech-name>md files via recursive r.jina.ai/<url> reader url fetches and multiple perplexity/claude calls, that would great . i should run it like pnpm generate:tech and then it search based on my queries, does a preplanning search step to get a search plan, executes perplexity searches to find any associated tech we can also crawl, crawls all urls with r.jina.ai/<url> reader urls, and then write out the docs/tech for whatever i prompted 

so i could say 'nextjs ai vercel neon upstash'

cli responds with an interpretation / plan - an options / selectable list of individual 'tech' detected and <tech-name>.md to be written out 

also utilities to enhance existing docs/tech/<techname>.md would be great in this cli - pnpm generate:tech should be in an interactive cli with @charm.md
