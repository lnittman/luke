# CLI Application Framework

> Modern command-line application development framework with AI-enhanced capabilities

## Overview

This framework provides a solid foundation for building powerful, intelligent command-line applications with rich terminal user interfaces and AI capabilities. It's designed for creating CLI tools that leverage language models for enhanced productivity, context-aware interactions, and automation capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Rich Terminal UI**: Advanced text-based interfaces with components, layouts and animations
- **AI Integration**: Native support for LLM-powered features and interactions
- **Modern UX**: Intuitive, keyboard-driven experiences with visual polish
- **Performant Architecture**: Optimized for speed and responsiveness
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works consistently across operating systems

## Ideal Use Cases

- **Developer Tools**: Code generation, refactoring assistants, project management
- **Data Analysis**: Interactive data exploration, natural language querying
- **Content Creation**: Document generation, text transformation, formatting
- **System Administration**: Intelligent monitoring, log analysis, configuration
- **Knowledge Management**: Personal knowledge bases, search, summarization

## Technical Highlights

### Frontend

- **TUI Framework**: Bubble Tea (Go) or similar component-based terminal UI frameworks
- **Styling**: Lip Gloss (Go) or equivalent styling systems for terminal output
- **Input Handling**: Advanced keyboard and mouse interaction support
- **Rendering**: Efficient screen management with partial updates

### Backend

- **Language**: Go or Rust for performance and memory safety
- **AI Client**: Optimized API clients for OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models
- **State Management**: Clean, predictable state flow with efficient updates
- **Data Storage**: Local database for persistent storage and caching

### AI Features

- **Contextual Understanding**: Maintains conversation and command context
- **Command Assistance**: Helps users discover and use complex commands
- **Content Generation**: Creates documents, code, or data based on instructions
- **Natural Language Interface**: Allows plain language interaction with the system

## Architecture

The framework follows a modular, component-based architecture:

```
cli-app/
├── cmd/                # Command definitions
├── internal/
│   ├── ai/            # AI integration
│   ├── config/        # Application configuration
│   ├── db/            # Data persistence
│   ├── tui/           # Terminal UI components
│   └── utils/         # Helper utilities

├── go.mod             # Dependency management
└── README.md          # Documentation
```

## Getting Started

1. Choose your programming language (Go or Rust recommended)
2. Set up your command structure with a framework like Cobra or Clap
3. Integrate terminal UI components for rich interfaces
4. Add AI capabilities through API clients
5. Implement state management and persistence
6. Build, test, and package your application

## Best Practices

- Design for keyboard-first interactions
- Provide clear visual feedback for all operations
- Implement progressive disclosure of complex features
- Cache AI responses for performance and offline use
- Support comprehensive help documentation
- Ensure accessibility for users with diverse needs
