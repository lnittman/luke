# CLI Application Architecture Guide

This document outlines the architecture, design decisions, and implementation patterns for modern command-line applications.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Command-Based Design
- Use the Command pattern for actions
- Implement subcommands for related functionality
- Support flags and arguments consistently
- Follow POSIX standards for option naming

### 2. Layered Architecture
- UI layer: Human interface and formatting
- Command layer: Business logic
- Service layer: Core functionality
- Infrastructure layer: External systems, filesystem, network

### 3. Configuration Management
- Support multiple configuration sources
- Implement hierarchical configuration
- Provide sensible defaults
- Support environment-specific configurations

## Design Patterns

### Command Pattern
```
RootCommand
├── SubcommandA
│   ├── SubcommandA1
│   └── SubcommandA2
└── SubcommandB
    ├── SubcommandB1
    └── SubcommandB2
```

### Dependency Injection
- Constructor/functional injection
- Service locator pattern (when appropriate)
- Factory functions for complex dependencies
- Testable interfaces

### Repository Pattern
- Abstract data access
- Support multiple storage backends
- Consistent CRUD operations
- Testable with mocks

## User Experience Design

### Terminal UI Principles
- Progressive disclosure
- Consistent layout
- Clear feedback
- Keyboard navigability
- Accessibility support

### Output Formatting
- Structured output for program consumption
- Human-readable output by default
- Support for multiple output formats (JSON, YAML, table)
- Color and style for visual hierarchy

### Input Handling
- Validation and sanitization
- Error reporting and recovery
- Default values and suggestions
- Interactive and non-interactive modes

## Error Handling Strategy

### Error Types
- User errors (invalid input, permissions)
- System errors (filesystem, network)
- Application errors (bugs, unexpected states)
- Recoverable vs. fatal errors

### Error Reporting
- Clear error messages
- Contextual information
- Suggested solutions
- Appropriate exit codes
- Debug information when verbose

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing
- Test business logic in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error handling
- Parameterized tests for edge cases

### Integration Testing
- Test command interaction
- Test configuration loading
- Test file operations
- Test with mock servers

### End-to-End Testing
- Automate CLI execution
- Test with expected input/output
- Test against real external systems
- Snapshot testing for output

## Performance Considerations

### Startup Time
- Lazy loading for rarely used commands
- Efficient configuration parsing
- Minimal dependencies in critical path
- Pre-compilation of templates

### Memory Management
- Streaming for large data processing
- Buffer management for I/O operations
- Resource cleanup
- Memory usage monitoring

### Concurrency
- Parallelism for independent operations
- Progress reporting for long-running tasks
- Cancellation support
- Rate limiting for API calls

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation
- Sanitize all user input
- Validate file paths
- Prevent command injection
- Quote/escape special characters

### Credential Management
- Secure storage of credentials
- Integration with system keyrings
- Token-based authentication
- Support for OAuth flows

### Code Security
- Dependency scanning
- Code signing
- Supply chain security
- Regular dependency updates

## Extensibility

### Plugin Architecture
- Support for plugins/extensions
- Well-defined plugin API
- Versioned plugin interface
- Discovery mechanism

### Customization
- Themable UI
- Custom formatters
- User-defined commands
- Extension points

## Cross-Platform Support

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- File path handling
- Terminal capabilities
- Line endings
- Shell differences

### Consistency
- Uniform behavior across platforms
- Platform-specific optimizations when needed
- Fallbacks for unsupported features
- Consistent user experience

## Packaging and Distribution

### Binary Distribution
- Single binary deployment
- Cross-compilation
- Version information embedded
- Platform-specific builds

### Package Managers
- Homebrew for macOS
- Apt/RPM for Linux
- Chocolatey/Scoop for Windows
- npm/cargo for language-specific distribution

## Observability

### Logging
- Structured logging
- Log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Configurable output destinations
- Context enrichment

### Telemetry
- Opt-in usage statistics
- Performance metrics
- Error reporting
- Feature usage tracking
