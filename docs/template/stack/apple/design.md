# Apple Platform Architecture Guide

This document outlines the architecture, design decisions, and implementation patterns for modern Apple platform applications.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. SwiftUI-First Approach
- Use SwiftUI as the primary UI framework
- Create reusable view components and modifiers
- Leverage the SwiftUI Navigation API
- Combine with UIKit/AppKit when needed using representable wrappers

### 2. State Management Patterns
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): For simpler features
- The Composable Architecture (TCA): For complex features
- Redux-style state management with Combine
- Observation framework for property observation

### 3. Data Architecture
- Swift Data for local persistence
- Core Data for complex data models
- CloudKit for synchronization
- CRUD operations with repository pattern

## Design Patterns

### UI Component Composition
```
BaseComponent (modifiers)
└── ThemedComponent (styles)
    └── FeatureComponent (functionality)
        └── ScreenComponent (composition)
```

### Dependency Injection
- Property injection
- Environment values
- Factory pattern
- Dependency containers

### Navigation Architecture
- Programmatic navigation with NavigationStack/NavigationSplitView
- Path-based navigation
- Coordinator pattern for complex flows
- Deep linking support

## Module Organization

### Feature-Based Structure
- Each feature in its own directory
- Shared components in UI module
- Core functionality in Core module
- Feature-specific models and views together

### Framework Boundaries
- Core functionality as Swift packages
- Feature isolation with internal access control
- Explicit public interfaces
- Dependency rules for modules

## Data Flow

### Unidirectional Data Flow
- State flows down
- Events flow up
- Single source of truth
- Immutable data models

### Async/Await and Combine
- Use Swift Concurrency for asynchronous operations
- Combine for declarative data processing
- Structured concurrency with task groups
- Actor isolation for shared mutable state

## Persistence Strategy

### Swift Data Integration
- Model schema definition
- Relationship management
- Migration strategy
- Query optimization

### CloudKit Sync
- Record zones and types
- Conflict resolution
- Subscription management
- Private and shared databases

## Networking Architecture

### API Client Design
- Protocol-based API definitions
- Async/await networking methods
- Error handling and retry logic
- Request/response models

### Mock and Live Implementations
- Protocol-based design for testability
- Mock implementations for testing
- Live implementations for production
- Network interceptors for debugging

## Error Handling

### Graceful Error Recovery
- Typed errors with Swift's Result type
- User-facing error messages
- Retry mechanisms
- Crash reporting integration

### Logging and Analytics
- Structured logging system
- Privacy-preserving analytics
- Performance monitoring
- Crash and error reporting

## Testing Strategy

### XCTest Integration
- Unit tests for business logic
- UI tests for critical flows
- Test doubles for dependencies
- Snapshot testing for UI

### Test Coverage
- Critical path testing
- Model validation
- Error handling
- Edge cases

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Management
- Value types over reference types
- Weak references for delegates
- Automatic reference counting awareness
- Memory leak detection

### UI Performance
- Prefetching and caching
- View recycling
- Background processing
- Smooth animations

## Security Best Practices

### Data Protection
- Keychain for sensitive data
- App Transport Security
- App sandbox
- Data encryption

### Authentication
- Secure authentication flows
- Token management
- Biometric authentication
- OAuth integration

## Localization and Accessibility

### Internationalization
- String catalogs
- Right-to-left language support
- Locale-aware formatting
- Dynamic type support

### Accessibility
- VoiceOver compatibility
- Dynamic type support
- Sufficient contrast
- Accessibility labels and hints
