# Memory Bank 1

## Context Summary

This is the initial memory bank for [PROJECT_NAME]. It contains the initial project setup, key architectural decisions, and early implementation details. The project is a [SHORT_DESCRIPTION] using [TECH_STACK] technologies.

## Entries

### 2025-03-04T10:00:00Z - Initial Project Setup

Project initialized using the documentation provided. The core technology stack includes:
- Frontend: [FRONTEND_TECH]
- Backend: [BACKEND_TECH]
- Database: [DATABASE_TECH]

The architecture follows the patterns outlined in `design.md`, with a focus on [ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN]. The initial project structure has been set up according to the recommended organization in `code.md`.

Initial tasks identified:
1. Set up project repository
2. Configure development environment
3. Implement core data models
4. Create base component structure

### 2025-03-04T11:15:00Z - Decision: State Management Approach

After reviewing the requirements and tech stack, decided to use [STATE_MANAGEMENT_APPROACH] for state management because:
1. It aligns with the project's complexity level
2. It provides good performance for the expected data volume
3. It integrates well with [FRONTEND_TECH]

This approach will be used consistently across the application to maintain predictable data flow and state updates.

### 2025-03-04T14:30:00Z - Implementation: Core Data Models

Implemented the following core data models based on the specifications in `design.md`:
- `User`: Authentication and profile information
- `[MODEL_2]`: [PURPOSE]
- `[MODEL_3]`: [PURPOSE]

These models use [DATABASE_ORM] for database interaction and include validation using [VALIDATION_APPROACH]. The schema design ensures efficient queries for the main application workflows.

Key decisions:
- Used UUIDs for primary keys for better distribution and security
- Implemented soft deletion for all models to maintain data history
- Added timestamps for auditing purposes

Related code: `src/models/` directory

### 2025-03-04T16:45:00Z - Issue: Environment Configuration

Encountered an issue with environment configuration not being properly loaded in the development environment. The problem was related to [ISSUE_DETAILS].

Solution implemented:
1. Updated the configuration loading process to use [SOLUTION_APPROACH]
2. Added validation for required environment variables
3. Created a fallback mechanism for development environments

This ensures consistent environment handling across different deployment contexts.

Related code: `src/config/environment.ts`

### 2025-03-05T09:30:00Z - Implementation: Authentication Flow

Implemented the authentication flow including:
- User registration
- Login/logout functionality
- Password reset
- Session management

The implementation follows the security best practices outlined in `tech.md`, including:
- Secure password hashing using [HASHING_ALGORITHM]
- Rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
- JWT token validation and refresh mechanism
- CSRF protection

Next steps:
1. Implement role-based access control
2. Add social authentication options
3. Set up unit and integration tests for auth flows

### 2025-03-05T14:00:00Z - Reference: API Endpoints

Documenting the core API endpoints implemented so far:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Authentication |
|----------|--------|---------|----------------|
| `/api/auth/register` | POST | User registration | None |
| `/api/auth/login` | POST | User authentication | None |
| `/api/auth/logout` | POST | End user session | Required |
| `/api/auth/reset-password` | POST | Password reset request | None |
| `/api/auth/reset-password/:token` | PUT | Execute password reset | None |
| `/api/users/me` | GET | Get current user profile | Required |
| `/api/[RESOURCE]` | GET | [PURPOSE] | [AUTH_REQ] |

These endpoints follow the RESTful design patterns specified in the architecture documentation.

### 2025-03-05T16:30:00Z - Decision: Frontend Routing Strategy

Selected the following approach for frontend routing:
- Using [ROUTING_LIBRARY] for route management
- Implementing lazy loading for route components to improve initial load time
- Setting up route-based code splitting
- Adding route guards for authenticated sections

This approach provides a balance between performance and maintainability, while ensuring proper access control.

### 2025-03-06T10:00:00Z - Implementation: Core UI Components

Implemented the following reusable UI components:
- `Button`: Primary interaction component with multiple variants
- `Form`: Form container with validation integration
- `Input`: Text input with validation support
- `Select`: Dropdown selection component
- `Modal`: Dialog/modal window component
- `[COMPONENT]`: [PURPOSE]

These components follow the design system outlined in the documentation and include:
- Accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
- Responsive design considerations
- Theme integration
- Comprehensive prop validation

### 2025-03-06T15:00:00Z - Task Planning: Next Implementation Phase

Based on progress so far, the following tasks are planned for the next phase:
1. Implement [FEATURE_1] functionality
2. Set up unit testing for existing components
3. Implement [FEATURE_2] workflow
4. Add error handling and logging system
5. Create initial admin interface

Estimated timeline:
- [FEATURE_1]: 1-2 days
- Testing setup: 1 day
- [FEATURE_2]: 2-3 days
- Error handling: 1 day
- Admin interface: 2-3 days

Dependencies and potential challenges have been identified and documented in the relevant sections of the codebase.
