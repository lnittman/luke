3. SOLI
(so-lee: light, sun, “solo”/“soul”, and feels airy)
Elevator Pitch
SOLI is a “thought garden” where each prompt seeds a living, visual ecosystem.
Users “plant” ideas (prompts), and each Mastra-powered tool transforms those seeds into evolving “plants”—abstract generative forms, clusters, or living networks.
As users continue to interact, their garden grows, mutates, cross-pollinates, and becomes a unique map of their thought journey. Every action is an agentic tool call: cross-linking, summarizing, remixing, or “pollinating” ideas. The UI is pure ambient playground—plants “bloom” as the user hovers, ideas branch, and everything feels tactile, alive.

Domain: Creative thinking, brainstorming, mood mapping, associative journaling, ambient knowledge management

Mastra tools: Plant, graft, cross-pollinate, prune, bloom

Generative UI: Animated, ambient “garden” or “grove” that reacts in real time; every idea is a plant, branch, or flower; occasional AI “rain” to nourish your garden

Vibe: Pure zen + play—like OP-1 meets Myst, but for the mind; visually hypnotic and relaxing

Example Use:

“Drop in a memory, a dream, or a daily goal. SOLI turns it into a plant. Ask it to bloom, and it generates associations, quotes, or moods. Cross-pollinate two plants for a surprising hybrid thought.”

Return daily to see how your garden grows and what new things have bloomed.
